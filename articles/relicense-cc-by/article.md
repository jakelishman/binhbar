I originally licensed the text of all of my blog posts on this website under the [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike version 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)][cc-by-sa-4].
Concurrent with this blog post, I am changing the licence I distribute my posts on this website to [Creative Commons Attribution version 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)][cc-by-4], dropping the share-alike requirement, including all previous posts.
You can still use blog posts dated before the 1st of April, 2024 under the terms of the CC BY-SA 4.0 that they were originally distributed with if you so choose, though to my understanding, CC BY 4.0 is strictly more permissive for the licensee.
Code samples remain licensed under the [MIT licence](/CODE_LICENCE.txt).

The longer I have been a professional software developer, the less interest I have had in reciprocity conditions in licensing.
I originally used CC BY-SA 4.0 simply because that was what Wikipedia did at the time I needed to choose a licence, and that seemed fine to me.
Thinking again now, I see no benefit in enforcing the reciprocity condition.
