# [About me](${about})

I'm Jake Lishman, a research software developer at IBM Quantum.
Almost all of [my work is open source][me-gh].
You'll see me most often as a maintainer of [Qiskit Terra][terra-gh] and a language designer of [OpenQASM 3][oq3].
These days I primarily work in Python, Rust and C++, but I've written plenty of pure C, Cython, Mathematica and F# in the past as well.

I have a PhD from the [Quantum Information][qi] and [Ion Trapping][ions] groups at Imperial College London in the UK, under [Prof.  Florian Mintert][flo] and [Prof. Richard Thompson][richard].
My PhD work was on making ion-trap gates for quantum computers a little bit closer to reality.
I used classical optimal control theory coupled with fast numerical methods to design gates that are robust against real-world errors, even when conditions aren't perfect.
You can find [a copy of my thesis here][thesis].

I got my start in open-source software working on [QuTiP][qutip] ([GitHub page][qutip-gh]), a major quantum simulation library.
My most major user-facing contributions were designing and writing the multiple-dispatch system for the new data layer of QuTiP 5, and upgrading our sparse-matrix arthimetic algorithms.
I was a core admin and maintainer from summer 2020 until July 2021, when I started at IBM Quantum.
I'm largely inactive on QuTiP these days.

## Publications

For each of my publications, you can find the journal and preprint links below.
I have also hosted a version of each here on my website, under the "direct" links.
These are always the most recent version that I retain the rights to distribute; for a lot of journals, this is exactly the same as the published version.

Authors marked with an asterisk (&#42;) are credited as joint first authors on the given paper.

Papers which have been published by a journal such as the Physical Review are copyright by the respective publisher, even if you get the file from my site.
