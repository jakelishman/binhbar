# [About me](${about})

I'm Jake Lishman, a theoretical physics PhD student in the
[Quantum Information][qi] and [Ion Trapping][ions] groups at Imperial College
London in the UK, under [Dr.  Florian Mintert][flo] and
[Prof. Richard Thompson][richard].

My PhD work has been on making ion-trap gates for quantum computers a little bit
closer to reality; I use classical optimal control theory coupled with fast
numerical methods to design gates that are robust against real-world errors,
even when conditions aren't perfect.

I'm a maintainer and on the admin team of [QuTiP][qutip] ([GitHub
page][qutip-gh]), a major quantum simulation library written in Python.  I have
been heavily involved in designing and writing the new data-layer types and
multiple dispatch system that will be coming in QuTiP 5.0, in Python, Cython and
a little bit of C++.

## Publications

For each of my publications, you can find the journal and preprint links below.
I have also hosted a version of each here on my website, under the "direct" links.
These are always the most recent version that I retain the rights to distribute; for a lot of journals, this is exactly the same as the published version.

Papers which have been published by a journal such as the Physical Review are copyright by the respective publisher, even if you get the file from my site.
