# [About me](${about})

I'm Jake Lishman, a theoretical physics PhD student in the
[Quantum Information][qi] and [Ion Trapping][ions] groups at Imperial College
London in the UK, under [Dr.  Florian Mintert][flo] and
[Prof. Richard Thompson][richard].

My PhD work has been on making ion-trap gates for quantum computers a little bit
closer to reality; I use classical optimal control theory coupled with fast
numerical methods to design gates that are robust against real-world errors,
even when conditions aren't perfect.

I also contribute a lot of code to [QuTiP][qutip] ([GitHub page][qutip-gh]), a
major quantum simulation library written in Python.  I have been heavily
involved in designing and writing the new data-layer types and multiple dispatch
system that will be coming in QuTiP 5.0, in Python, Cython and a little bit of
C++.
