# [About me](/about/)

I'm Jake Lishman, a theoretical physics PhD student in the
[Quantum Information][qi] and [Ion Trapping][ions] groups at Imperial College
London in the UK, under [Dr.  Florian Mintert][flo] and
[Prof. Richard Thompson][richard].  I work on making ion-trap gates used in
quantum computers, especially on making them robust enough against real-world
errors to make them usable in a real-life quantum computer.
